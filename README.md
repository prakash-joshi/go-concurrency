## Test Commands üõ†Ô∏è

Here are the essential commands for running and analyzing Go test cases:

### Basic Testing

```bash
go test -v -cover ./...
```

Runs all tests recursively with verbose output and displays coverage in terminal.

### Race Condition Testing

```bash
go test -race .
```

Executes test cases with race condition detection in the current directory.

```bash
go test -race -v .
```

Same as above but with verbose output for detailed test execution information.

### Coverage Analysis

```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out
```

Generates a coverage profile file (`coverage.out`) for detailed analysis.

```bash
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

Creates an interactive HTML report from the coverage profile, allowing visual exploration of test coverage in your browser.
